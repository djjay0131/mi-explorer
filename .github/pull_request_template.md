## Governance Level

Declare exactly one level (definitions: agentic-governance
`llm/governance/governance-levels.md`). Uncertain classification is semantic — pick
the lowest plausible semantic level.

- [ ] L0 — Administrative (non-semantic). Complete and include the
      Administrative Change Certification block from agentic-governance
      `llm/governance/l0-fast-track.md` in this PR body. **Note: this repo's
      Steward Activation Status is INACTIVE, so an L0 PR still merges by
      human hand — the label changes the review lane, not the merge lane.**
- [ ] L1 — Governance & Architecture (semantic; human review required)
- [ ] L2 — Implementation (semantic; human review required)
- [ ] L3 — Product (semantic; human review required)
